# Emad's Blockchain
This project is an implementation for [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) concept in Java.

## How it works:
- The blocks are generated by multiple miners concurrently, that keep trying to find valid blocks.
- Blocks should have the hash of the previous block in the chain.
- Block's hash should start with a number of zeros controlled by the blockchain.
- Miners finding valid blocks are awarded with an amount of virtual currency

## Theory used in the app:
The app is using many Java concepts. Most importantly: 
- Multithreading 
- Thread Sync
- Executors
- Collections
- Streams
- RegEx
- Records
- Hashing
